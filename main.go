		Let's define handler first: A handler is a thing (function or object) that takes an incoming HTTP request

		resolve correctly inside the embedded "web/static" folder.

		PathPrefix("/static/") from Gorilla Mux matches any URL that begins with "/static/", letting us mount
		everything under that path.

		http.StripPrefix("/static/", ...) removes /static/ from the incoming URL path before passing is to the file server.
		For example, request "/static/css/app.css" -> file server sees "css/app.css"

		.Handler(...) attaches an http.Handler (instead of a function) to this route.
		http.FileServer(...) returns an http.Handler that knows how to serve files.

		http.FileServer(http.FS(staticFiles)) creates an HTTP handler that serves files from the embedded FS.
		http.FS() converts Goâ€™s generic fs.FS (implemented by embed.FS) into the http.FileSystem interface
		that FileServer expects.
