		Let's define handler first: A handler is a thing (function or object) that takes an incoming HTTP request
		and writes back a response.

		fs.Sub(staticFS, "web/static") re-roots the embedded filesystem so that lookups like "css/main.css"
		resolve correctly inside the embedded "web/static" folder.

		PathPrefix("/static/") from Gorilla Mux matches any URL that begins with "/static/", letting us mount
		everything under that path.

		http.StripPrefix("/static/", ...) removes /static/ from the incoming URL path before passing is to the file server.
		For example, request "/static/css/app.css" -> file server sees "css/app.css"

		.Handler(...) attaches an http.Handler (instead of a function) to this route.
		http.FileServer(...) returns an http.Handler that knows how to serve files.

		http.FileServer(http.FS(staticFiles)) creates an HTTP handler that serves files from the embedded FS.

		http.FS() converts Goâ€™s generic fs.FS (implemented by embed.FS) into the http.FileSystem interface
		that FileServer expects; This helps wrap it so that HTTP functions can read files from it

		fs.Sub helps create a sub-view of that filesystem that starts inside web/static, since we don't want
		to keep looking up web/static/css/main.css, we just want css/main.css when the browser asks
		for /static/css/main.css; Returns an fs.FS, which is still a virtual file system view

		Handlers in summary will read files from a filesystem and write them to a web response when requested.

		If "css/main.css" was requested, then the "fs := ..." line will:
		1. open that file from the virtual filesystem,
		2. read its contents, and
		3. write the bytes to the browser as the HTTP response
