		Let's define handler first: A handler is a thing (function or object) that takes an incoming HTTP request
		and writes back a response.

		fs.Sub(staticFS, "web/static") re-roots the embedded filesystem so that lookups like "css/main.css"
		resolve correctly inside the embedded "web/static" folder.

		PathPrefix("/static/") from Gorilla Mux matches any URL that begins with "/static/", letting us mount
		everything under that path.

		http.StripPrefix("/static/", ...) removes /static/ from the incoming URL path before passing is to the file server.
		For example, request "/static/css/app.css" -> file server sees "css/app.css"

		.Handler(...) attaches an http.Handler (instead of a function) to this route.
		http.FileServer(...) returns an http.Handler that knows how to serve files.

		http.FileServer(http.FS(staticFiles)) creates an HTTP handler that serves files from the embedded FS.

		http.FS() converts Goâ€™s generic fs.FS (implemented by embed.FS) into the http.FileSystem interface
		that FileServer expects; This helps wrap it so that HTTP functions can read files from it

		fs.Sub helps create a sub-view of that filesystem that starts inside web/static, since we don't want
		to keep looking up web/static/css/main.css, we just want css/main.css when the browser asks
		for /static/css/main.css; Returns an fs.FS, which is still a virtual file system view

		Handlers in summary will read files from a filesystem and write them to a web response when requested.

		If "css/main.css" was requested, then the "fs := ..." line will:
		1. open that file from the virtual filesystem,
		2. read its contents, and
		3. write the bytes to the browser as the HTTP response

	Some notes:
	http.ResponseWriter will be the pipe back to the user's browser where that variable is used to write the response.

	w.Write([]byte("Hello!"))           // Send text
	w.WriteHeader(404)                   // Set status code
	w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")  // Set headers

	http.Request is going to be the variable that contains all the information about the incoming request.
	This could be URLs, headers, cookies, form data, etc.
	It allows us to do things like:

	r.URL.Path           // "/about"
	r.Method            // "GET" or "POST"
	r.Header.Get("Authorization")  // Get a header
